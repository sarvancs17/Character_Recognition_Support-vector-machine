# Handwritten Character Recognition

Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) is a deep learning-based project designed to recognize and classify handwritten characters. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of handwritten characters to achieve high accuracy.


## Features

Supports recognition of uppercase and lowercase alphabets.

Utilizes a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras.

Uses OpenCV for image preprocessing.

Achieves high accuracy with a well-trained CNN model.

Can be integrated into real-world applications such as OCR systems.


## Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV

NumPy & Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn


# Dataset

The project uses a standard handwritten character dataset such as the load_digits dataset collected for training and evaluation.

* from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
